1. We will install ui-router as a bower component
	
	bower install angular-ui-router --save

2. in index.html replace/check if angular-ui-router.js is incleded in place of angular-route.js
   NOTE: first only comment old one and include new one.

3. check if you have included ui.router as dependency in main module. If you have removed/commented angular-route.js also remove/comment
